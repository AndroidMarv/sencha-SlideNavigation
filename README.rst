Slide Navigation
================

This is an attempt to make a Facebook-like navigation panel for Sencha Touch 2,
however with a difference that the menu items are dropdown.

We have to NOT yet uploaded a demo.
When you try it on your system, navigation menu in the example, "flick" the 
toolbar (at the top) to the right; the opposite action can be used to close 
the menu.

This is a work in progress. You may have to look into the code or ask us to 
modify some of the behaviors.

Getting Started
---------------

Using the SlideNavigation view in your project is now easier than before.  All you need
to do is place the 'ux' folder somewhere within your application, then add the following
to your app (at the top of 'app.js' is a good place)::

    Ext.Loader.setConfig({enabled:true});
    Ext.Loader.setPath('Ext.ux', './ux');

Adjust './ux' to wherever you actually placed the 'ux' folder.

Note: If you are using this with other components that also use the 'Ext.ux' namespace,
simply place the 'ux/slidenavigation' folder into the same location that you've placed
the other 'Ext.ux' components.

Then in whatever component you wish to use the view, add::

    requires = [
        'Ext.ux.slidenavigation.View',
    ]

or simply extend the 'Ext.ux.slidenavigation.View' class.

For a more complete example, see `app/view/Main.js`.

Building the Example Application
--------------------------------

To build the example you need to put Sencha Touch into a folder named sdk.  Then run::

    ./sdk/commands/sencha app build -e testing

This will produce the example app in the `build/testing` directory.


Notes
-----

So far this has been tested on:

  * iOS 5 (iPhone and iPad)
  * Android 4.0.3
  * Android 3.2 (tablet)
  * Android 2.3.3
